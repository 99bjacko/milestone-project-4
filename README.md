## Objective and Initial Concept

In this project, I intend to create an e-commerce site selling cosmetic products, focusing on skincare. The goal of this website is to become a one-stop shop where users can learn about how to care for their skin and also buy products that are proven to keep skin healthy and protected. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Django along with using relational databases, Stripe payments, and Bootstrap.

The target audience for this website is people who are looking to get into skincare but aren't sure where to start, but this site is also suitable for people who have experience with skincare that are looking to purchase some of the most effective products out there.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to product wireframes. This step allows for planning layouts and page structures, allowing to focus more on the website looking like the designs, instead of trying to simultaneously code and design.

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project was based around simplicity, to make the aesthetic both simple but appealing, allowing the focus to be on the products and the content, rather than the other aspects around them.
The majority of the website is built around black or grey text on a white background, with use of greys and colours taken from Bootstrap throughout the site where appropriate.

#### Typography

The 'Inter' typeface was chosen for this project and was picked using Google Fonts.

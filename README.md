## Objective and Initial Concept

In this project, I intend to create an e-commerce site selling cosmetic products, focusing on skincare. The goal of this website is to become a one-stop shop where users can learn about how to care for their skin and also buy products that are proven to keep skin healthy and protected. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Django along with using relational databases, Stripe payments, and Bootstrap.

The target audience for this website is people who are looking to get into skincare but aren't sure where to start, but this site is also suitable for people who have experience with skincare that are looking to purchase some of the most effective products out there.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to product wireframes. This step allows for planning layouts and page structures, allowing to focus more on the website looking like the designs, instead of trying to simultaneously code and design.

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project was based around simplicity, to make the aesthetic both simple but appealing, allowing the focus to be on the products and the content, rather than the other aspects around them.
The majority of the website is built around black or grey text on a white background, with use of greys and colours taken from Bootstrap throughout the site where appropriate.

#### Typography

The 'Inter' typeface was chosen for this project and was picked using Google Fonts.

## Bugs

- Edit and delete buttons were being hidden on smaller screens
    - Altered columns so they were always visible on all screens to superusers.
- Email confirmations were still showing up with example.com as the domain name. This was temporarily fixed after troubleshooting with Tutor Support by changing the SITE_ID to 2 in settings.py. After returning to the project the next day, there were errors about the site not being found. Changed the SITE_ID back to 1 and the issues have been resolved and the email confirmations seem to be working.
- Python 'TypeError' when trying to register a new account on Heroku
    - Included a runtime.txt to specify Python Version 3.9.16 for Heroku to use. This solution was found on Slack.

## Deployment

### Live deployment

The website is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and can be found [here](https://revitalise-project-0a7838062db9.herokuapp.com/)

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub repository allows a copy of the original repository to be made without affecting the original repository. This can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Navigate to the GitHub repository for this project, milestone-project-3
3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Navigate to the GitHub repository for this project, milestone-project-3
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS"
4. Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the location you want to use for the cloned directory
5. Use the git clone command with the URL copied in Step 3

### Local Deployment

To deploy the project locally, you must either fork or clone this [repository](https://github.com/99bjacko/milestone-project-4).

After forking or cloning the repository, in your IDE:
- Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
- Create an `env.py` file for storing environment variables. Add this to .gitignore if it isn't already.
- Your env.py should look similar to the one below

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's secret key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's stripe public key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's stripe secret key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's stripe webhook signing secret")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

### Deployment to Heroku

These instructions have been adapted from [Jumpers For Goalposts](https://github.com/nicksmith100/ms4-jumpersforgoalposts)

In order to deploy the project to Heroku successfully, you will need the following:
- A Heroku account.
- A hosted PostgresSQL database, such as one through Amazon Web Services.
- An Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage account.
- A Stripe account.
- An email account.

Set up the database before attempting the next steps. You will need your database URL.

#### Set up Heroku and connecting your database

1. In Heroku, click on the 'New' button then 'create new app'.
2. Name your app and select the region closest to you.
3. After setting up your app, go to the settings tab and under Config Vars click 'Reveal Config Vars' and add a new variable with the key of `DATABASE_URL` and the value being your database URL.
4. In your IDE, go to settings.py and paste the following code in to your DATABASE section to connect to the new database
```
DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('user's database url'))
    }
```
5. In your IDE terminal, type `python3 manage.py showmigrations`. If you are connected, you will see a list of migrations with no ticks next to them.
6. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to migrate the database structure from your project to the new database. Please note that any data that you have added to the project level SQLite database will not transfer to the new database. You will need to populate the site on the deployed app or use fixtures (JSON files containing database content).
7. Run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the instructions to create a superuser.
8. Remove your new database settings from settings.py
9. In your IDE environment variables, add a key of DEVELOPMENT and a value of True.
10. In settings.py, go to the DATABASES section and replace what's currently there with the following
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
11. Commit and push to GitHub

#### Deploying to Heroku

1. Create a Procfile in your app in the root directory with the following content `web: gunicorn revitalise.wsgi:application` and a blank line at the end.
2. Log in to Heroku using the IDE terminal using the command `Heroku login` and enter your Heroku email and password. (If you have 2 factor authentication set up you will need to use `Heroku login -i` followed by your email and your Heroku API key as the password which you can find in your account settings on Heroku.)
3. Temporarily disable Heroku from collecting static files during deployment using the command `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name`
4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
5. On the Heroku dashboard, navigate to the Deploy tab and select Github, search for your repository by name and click 'connect'.
6. Go back to the Deploy tab and click on 'Enable Automatic Deploys'.
7. Click 'Deploy Branch'.
8. Once build is complete, your site will be deployed without any of the static files (CSS, JavaScript & Media files).
9. In Heroku settings, scroll down to 'Domains' and copy the 'your app can be found at' URL.
10. In your IDE, go to settings.py and add your deployed site's URL to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
11. You now need to replace the Django secret key in your settings.py (if you included it there) with an environment variable to keep it safe. To do this you can use a Django secret key generator online e.g. [djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/), copy the key it provides.
12. Go to your Heroku app's dashboard, open settings and reveal config variables and add a new variable with a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of what you just copied.
13. In your IDE environment variables, add a key of SECRET_KEY and a value of a different Django secret key from your online key generator (djecrety or similar).
14. In settings.py change the SECRET_KEY to `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`
15. Below it change the value of DEBUG to the following `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ` to dynamically change whether the app is in DEBUG mode depending on whether it is the development or deployed site.
16. Commit and push your changes to Github.

#### Setting Up Your Static Files on Your Deployed Site using Amazon Web Services (AWS)

1. In your Amazon Web Services S3 account click on 'create bucket' and name it to match your Heroku app, selecting your closest region and uncheck 'block all public access' then click on create bucket to set it up.
2. Click on your new bucket name and go to the properties tab.
3. Scroll to the bottom and click on the edit button by 'Static Website Hosting' and select 'enable', giving default values for the index and error documents (index.html & error.html) then click save changes.
4. Go to the permissions tab and copy the ARN value at the top.
5. Scroll down to the bucket policy section, select 'edit' and 'policy generator'.
6. Select 'S3 bucket policy' from the dropdown.
7. In principles put a * to allow all.
8. Set the action to 'Get Object'.
9. Paste the earlier ARN value in the ARN input.
10. Click on 'add statement' then 'generate policy'
11. Copy the policy text that the generator creates.
12. Back in your bucket settings paste the text in to the Bucket Policy empty text area then add a '/*' to the end of the resource value (which should have your bucket name in it), and click save. This will allow access to all the resources in the bucket.
13. Scroll down to the access control list and grant Read and Write access to Everyone (public access) by checking the boxes.
14. Scroll down to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) section and paste in the following and save:

```
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

15. Go back to your AWS dashboard by clicking on the AWS logo at the top left and type in IAM in the search bar and select the IAM service.
16. Click on the user groups tab and create a new group, with the name of your choice, ideally with your app name in it and create the group.
17. Go to the policies tab and create a policy, go the JSON tab and search for the S3FullAccess policy and import it.
18. Edit the policy to the following:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
19. Click on next and then review.
20. Name the policy and give it a description and then create your policy.
21. Go to the User Groups tab, select your group and go to permissions and click 'add permissions' then 'attach policy' selecting your newly created policy and clicking 'Attach policies'.
22. Create a user for the group by going to the User tab and clicking 'create user'.
23. Name your user (you don't need to select AWS Console access) click next and add your user to your group clicking next as required and 'create user'.
24. Download and save the csv file with the user's credentials - this is important, you will not be able to access this information again.
25. Back in your IDE go to your settings.py file and paste in the following code which tells the app to look for an environment variable called USE_AWS and if it's there to use the following settings to access the static files.
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache Control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000'
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'revitalise-project'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-north-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
26. Set up the following config variables in Heroku using the information in the csv file that you downloaded:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: user's access key
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: user's secret access key
  - USE_AWS: True
27. Remove COLLECTSTATIC from the config variables in Heroku
28. Back in your IDE create a file called custom_storages.py in the root directory and add the following:
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

```
29. In settings.py add the following to tell it to look for the new storage classes we just created in custom_storages and to override the URLS for static and media files. Put this just below the AWS code from earlier within the if `'USE_AWS' in os.environ` statement.

```
# Static and media files
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

# Override static and media URLs in production
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

30. Save your settings.py then push to push your changes to GitHub.
31. Once the deployment has finished check your S3 bucket, there should be a static folder in there with your static files (CSS / JS folders with files inside) and the live site should now have its CSS styling and any JavaScript functionality.
32. Finally to add your media files simply go back to AWS, create a new folder called 'media' in the same place as the new 'static' folder, click on the folder and drag and drop all your media files in to the browser window.
33. Click next and under manage public permissions select 'grant public access to these objects' and click upload.
34. Your site should now contain all your media and static files.

#### Setting up Stripe Payments on your deployed site

1. Log in to Stripe, browse to the [API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) tab and copy the API key and set them in Heroku as config variables in the following:

- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: Stripe public key goes here
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Stripe secret key goes here

2. Back in Stripe set up a new webhook for your deployed site by clicking on webhooks, click on 'add endpoint', paste in your deployed site's URL and add '/checkout/wh/' at the end of it. Set it to listen for all events.
3. Click on your newly set up webhook and click on 'Signing Secret' at the top to reveal the secret value. Copy it and set it as a new config variable in Heroku:
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET: Signing secret from new webhook.

#### Setting up emails on your deployed site

1. With your chosen email provider, set up an "app password". Note this is different to your standard account password, and is specifically to allow external apps to send emails from your account.
2. In Heroku add the following config variables:
- EMAIL_HOST: Your email host SMTP settings
- EMAIL_HOST_USER: Your email address
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD: Your app password

#### Checking Heroku config variables

Having followed all of the above steps you should see the following config variables in your Heroku settings:

  | Key | Value |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | _AWS Access Key_ (from the CSV file downloaded from your AWS S3 account) |
  | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | _Secret Access Key_ (from the CSV file downloaded from your AWS S3 account) |
  | USE_AWS | True |
  | DATABASE_URL | _Database URL_ (from your database settings)  |
  | EMAIL_HOST | _Email SMTP host_ (from your email account)|
  | EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | _Email app password_ (from your email account) |
  | EMAIL_HOST_USER | _Email address_ (from your email account) |
  | SECRET_KEY | _Secret Key_ (a generated Django secret key, e.g. using [djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/)) |
  | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | _Stripe Public Key_ (from your Stripe account - API keys) |
  | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | _Stripe Secret Key_ (from your Stripe account - API keys)|
  | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | _Stripe Webhook Secret_ (from your Stripe account - Webhooks) |

## Objective

In this project, I intend to create an e-commerce site selling cosmetic products, focusing on skincare. The goal of this website is to become a one-stop shop where users can learn about how to care for their skin and also buy products that are proven to keep skin healthy and protected. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Django along with using relational databases, Stripe payments, and Bootstrap.

The target audience for this website is people who are looking to get into skincare but aren't sure where to start, but this site is also suitable for people who have experience with skincare that are looking to purchase some of the most effective products out there.
